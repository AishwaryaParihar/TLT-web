I have been guided by him throughout my exam preparation. He has great teaching skills which arouse general curiosity amongst the students and keep them engaged during his lectures without getting bored or fatigued. He teaches every important topic comprehensively and with an analytical approach. The knowledge that he shares is accurate and precise. Most importantly, he enlightens his students by helping them distinguish between what is important and what is irrelevant from the examination point of view. He has a good command over subjects, like Cr.p.c, C.pc. and Evidence act, which are of utmost importance for any pcs j aspirant. His rapid revision classes  helped me immensely in covering up and revising my subjects efficiently and in much less time. Apart from subject knowledge, he is a great motivational speaker. He keeps motivating his students with his positive attitude and thus prevents them from getting depressed or discouraged during the preparation. He is an excellent judicial exam mentor and I recommend him to every pcs j aspirant. With Shubham Upadhyay Sir on board, I am very sure that The Law Tales Academy will provide quality guidance to the aspirants and help them in achieving their goals.",
